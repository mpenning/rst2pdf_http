# readline makes the python repl up-arrows work...
#
# If you compiled python without readline, ensure you have readline installed
# in your *nix distro; then you need to 'make clean' in your Python source
# tree, and recompile python (but it's worth it).
#
# I am leaving readline unversioned below in case you already have another
# readline version.
#
# strictly-speaking rst2pdf_http.py does not require readline, but in the
# long-run you wont regret the trouble to compile python with.
